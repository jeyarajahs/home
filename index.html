			<p>&ldquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

			<p>Have you ever thought about having a career as a web designer&quest; Maybe you want to work in the printing industry&quest; Are you curious and wish to learn something new&quest; If you answer yes to any of those question then you may want to know a little bit more about something called Lorem Ipsum, as it is commonly used in order to display designs to those who wish to use them without having to create content.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 id="subheading">What is Lorem Ipsum&quest;</h2>
			<p>Unlike common belief, Lorem Ipsum is not randomly generated text majorly due to the fact that the usage of Latin within the text makes it difficult to comprehend. However a latin professor at the Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia looked into the matter further, by researching into one of the more odd words out within a Lorem Ipsum passage, the word was “consectetur” . After pursuing the research by reviewing other passages, it was evident that Lorem Ipsum originates from the sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 in "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero which was created in 45 BC, making Lorem Ipsum over 2000 years old!</p>

			<h3 id="third">Influence in the 1500s</h3>
			<p>To this day it is unknown the person responsible for creating the standard, however it is know that the person responsible for drawing attention to it in the industry created a type specimen book. Lorem Ipsum later went on to becoming a standard of the typesetting and printers in the 1500s. Form there, it has made a massive leap from five centuries ago with the switch from typewriters to digital media, while astonishingly remaining unphased.</p>
			<h2 id="subheading">Current Usage of Lorem Ipsum to Date</h2>
			<p>Design is an important element to our society as it provides us with visual aid as well as gives offs an appeal to objects which can seem mundane or boring. With web pages, you are able to communicate to vast amounts of people and share ideas on certain subjects as well as be able to provide an immediate pull to it. Some designers resort to using Lorem Ipsum with the intention of either sharing their design, providing a service or both. However,  several others disagree with the usage of it considering it to be lazy. </p>
